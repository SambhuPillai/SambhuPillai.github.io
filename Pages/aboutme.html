		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello fellow readers! My name is Sam, and this webiste is dedicated to me and my journey...</p>
			<section>
			<h1>Education</h1>
			<p>I undertook a bachelors degree in Mathematics at the University of Reading. After three years of study in this course, I achieved a first class and straight away I decided to further my understanding in this subject by doing a masters. In 2016, I went to University College London to undertake a masters degree in Mathematical Modelling. Both universities provided different experiences for me, and if I was to compare both of them, I will definitely say Reading was by far the better university.</p>

			<h1>Work Experience</h1>
			<p>After I finished my masters degree, I decided that it is time for me to get some work experience. I joined a company called StreetPR, which was essentially being a brand ambassador for many brands, such as gyms, lesuire centers and stuff. I did this role mainly so I can start making some money as well as to get experience for future opportunities. I also did a bit of tutoring for A-level and GCSE Maths, which was something a did enjoy on the weekends. In 2018, I joined The Language Shop as a Service Coordinator. My role involved finding interpreters to cover bookings that were made by clients for their patients.</p>

			<h1>Other</h1>
			<p>One of my hobbies is I like tutoring now and then. It's something I like to do on the weekends. It keeps my maths skills fresh in my head and it acts as a stress relief for the hard labours I do during the week.</p>

			<h1>The Future</h1>
			<p>One of my goals that I would like to accomplish is to finish my maths website that I started quite a while ago, but I never went back to finish it off (I've been quite busy.) Another thing I have been thinking about is to do a phd in a Maths related field.
